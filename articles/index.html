                We’ve compiled a collection of beautiful living rooms featuring charming Christmas decorations. We believe that transforming the core of your home — wherever that may be — into a cozy and colorful interior allows that magic to take place.
                Whether you have a fireplace with stockings, a decorated Christmas tree, a colorful lighting installation or a creative message on one of the walls, the living room is the focal point of many residences and should set the tone for the entire house.
                We hope the photos below will help to inspire you this holiday season. Prefer less traditional decorations?

                   <p class="text">Luckily for one New York couple of empty-nesters, Interior Design Hall of Fame members Gisue Hariri and Mojgan Hariri know a thing or two about family dynamics—after all, the sisters are now in their fourth decade of running Hariri & Hariri Architecture, having previously studied together at Cornell University. And they used that knowledge to settle the couple into a more compact home while, at the same time, expanding their horizons.
                      In view of the High Line park and the Hudson River, an easy arm’s length from the foodie mecca of Chelsea Market, and a stone’s throw from the meatpacking district’s mayhem, Google has a new home. With space split between two Chelsea landmarks, National Biscuit Company buildings from 1898 and 1913, and revamped by Interior Architects, the search engine’s sales team enjoys impressive digs that are nevertheless decidedly understated. The goal here was to play against type by celebrating the low-tech and the local.
